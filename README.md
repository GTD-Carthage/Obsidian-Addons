# Obsidian-Addons
An assortment of addons for Obsidian Level Generator.

### Barebones Shape Grammar
An addon containing an extremely simple shape grammar to use as a basis for learning about the grammar system and creating your own. Maps will essentially be
a series of identical and directly connected squares.

### Doom 3 Resource Pack
An addon containing various new textures, prefabs, and themes based on Craneo's Doom 3 texture conversion for Doom. https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=72353

### Oblige 5.x Shape Grammar
An addon containing a shape grammar that strives to mimic the style of map generation used in the Oblige 5.x series. Indoor rooms are usually square or diamond-shaped, while caves have a more natural/organic layout. Hallways and joiners are also used to a degree.

### Realm 667 Monsters and Weapons Modules
An update to the module for mridlen's Oblige Realm667 Monsters and Weapons addon making it compatible with Lua 5.4/Obsidian. You will still need the Realm667.pk3 and Realm667_weapons.pk3 files from his repository at https://github.com/mridlen/Oblige_Realm667_Mod

### Remove Secret Stuffs
An addon that changes the occurence of target items in secret closets and rooms.
